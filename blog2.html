                <h2>Day #4</h2>
                <p class="top-pad"><cite>06-30-2023</cite></p>
                <p class="top-pad indent-me">So I ended up skipping a day of code. I know, I know. I really need to stay on top of my game. As much as I love to code though I do need time to relax and to stop problem solving my portfolio website. I believe if I do this I can prevent myself from burning out. I figured out from the last couple of times I tried to learn how to code that it is not a sprint. Coding is a marathon. You really need to pace yourself during the journey. To those people that got a coding job in three months congrats. I do not think my brain could handle that much computer science in three months of learning. I am going to take my time this time around. If you are checking out my website I hope you enjoy the buttons at the bottom of the page. This is what I did today and I felt like halloween today so they are orange. Have a great independence day weekend all.</p>
