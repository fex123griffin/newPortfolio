                <h2>Day #4</h2>
                <p class="top-pad"><cite>06-30-2023</cite></p>
                <p class="top-pad indent-me">So I ended up skipping a day of code. I know, I know. I really need to stay on top of my game. As much as I love to code though I do need time to relax and to stop problem solving my portfolio website. I believe if I do this I can prevent myself from burning out. I figured out from the last couple of times I tried to learn how to code that it is not a sprint. Coding is a marathon. You really need to pace yourself during the journey. To those people that got a coding job in three months congrats. I do not think my brain could handle that much computer science in three months of learning. I am going to take my time this time around. If you are checking out my website I hope you enjoy the buttons at the bottom of the page. This is what I did today and I felt like halloween today so they are orange. Have a great independence day weekend all.</p>

                <p class="top-pad"><cite>07-26-2023</cite></p>
                <p class="top-pad indent-me">It has been a while since the last time I updated this blog. I tried to learn too much in a short period of time. When it comes to learning things I realize that you need to take it slow. If you try to learn too much in one go it will eventually make you quit. I believe I will eventually learn this stuff. I just need to put things to practive everyday. I belive I will continue my 100 days of code. If i get a streak going i will be proud, if I do not get a streak for the week I need to make a promise to myself that i will not be so down on myself. So far I am proud of myself for making this website and that I believe will be my drive for this 100 days of code   </p>
